The world of tea and coffee is incredibly diverse, categorized by the plant species, the processing methods, and how they are eventually prepared.
🍵 Variants of Tea
All "true" tea comes from the same plant, Camellia sinensis. The variation comes from how much the leaves are oxidized (exposed to air). Anything not from this plant is technically a Tisane (herbal infusion).
1. The 7 Main "True" Teas
 * Black Tea: Fully oxidized. Strong, bold, and high in caffeine.
 * Green Tea: Unoxidized. Fresh, grassy, and rich in antioxidants.
 * White Tea: Minimally processed. Very delicate, light, and slightly sweet.
 * Oolong Tea: Partially oxidized. Falls between green and black; often floral or woody.
 * Pu-erh Tea: Fermented and aged. Earthy, deep, and often sold in pressed "cakes."
 * Yellow Tea: Rare and processed similarly to green tea but with a slow "smothering" phase.
 * Purple Tea: A rare Kenyan variety with purple leaves; high in unique antioxidants.
2. Popular Varieties & Regional Specialties
 * Matcha: Stone-ground Japanese green tea powder whisked into a froth.
 * Darjeeling: The "Champagne of teas" from India; light and muscatel.
 * Earl Grey: Black tea flavored with oil from the bergamot orange.
 * Lapsang Souchong: A smoke-dried black tea with a campfire-like aroma.
 * Masala Chai: Indian black tea brewed with milk, sugar, and spices (ginger, cardamom, cloves).
 * Moroccan Mint: Green tea (Gunpowder) steeped with fresh mint and sugar.
 * Yerba Mate: A South American herbal drink known for its high caffeine and earthy taste.
☕ Variants of Coffee
Coffee is primarily defined by the bean species, the roast level, and the brewing method.
1. The 4 Main Coffee Beans
 * Arabica: The most popular (60-70% of world production). Sweet, acidic, and complex.
 * Robusta: Stronger, more bitter, and has double the caffeine. Great for crema in espresso.
 * Liberica: Rare, with a smoky, floral, and "woody" flavor profile.
 * Excelsa: A sub-variety of Liberica with a tart, fruity, dark-fruit character.
2. Common Coffee Drinks
| Type | Composition |
|---|---|
| Espresso | A concentrated "shot" of coffee under high pressure. |
| Americano | Espresso diluted with hot water. |
| Latte | Espresso with a lot of steamed milk and a thin layer of foam. |
| Cappuccino | Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. |
| Flat White | Like a latte, but with a higher coffee-to-milk ratio and "microfoam." |
| Macchiato | Espresso "marked" with a tiny dollop of foam. |
| Mocha | A latte with chocolate syrup or powder added. |
| Cold Brew | Coffee grounds steeped in cold water for 12–24 hours (low acidity). |
3. Specialty & Luxury Variants
 * Geisha (Gesha): One of the world's most expensive beans, known for tea-like floral notes.
 * Kopi Luwak: Beans partially digested by a civet; known for an ultra-smooth, non-bitter taste.
 * Blue Mountain: A prestigious Jamaican coffee prized for its mildness and lack of bitterness.
 * Turkish Coffee: Very finely ground beans boiled in a cezve, served unfiltered with the grounds.
4. Roast Levels
 * Light Roast: High acidity, light body, retains the most "origin" flavor.
 * Medium Roast: Balanced flavor, acidity, and aroma (most common).
 * Dark Roast: Bitter, smoky, or oily; the original bean flavor is mostly replaced by roast notes.
