Figma Tips for Specialty Items:

1. The "7 Color Tea" (The Signature):
Since this is a visual marvel, don't use a solid color. In Figma, use a Linear Gradient for the ellipse:

Top: #3E2723 (Dark)

Middle 1: #8D6E63 (Tan)

Middle 2: #D7CCC8 (Cream)

Bottom: #5D4037 (Amber)

Add 7 stops in total to mimic the layers.

2. The "Edible Cookie Mug":

Since the mug itself is a snack, use a Warm Brown (#6F4E37) for the PNG mug color to make it look like a biscuit.

For the liquid inside, use the Espresso code (#1B1008).

3. Visual Differentiation:

For "Sparkling Water", use the Mineral Water hex (#E0F7FA) but add 5-6 tiny white circles (1px to 2px) on top with 50% opacity to represent the bubbles.

For "Malai Tea", place a slightly smaller, lighter-colored ellipse (#FFF9F0) inside your liquid ellipse to represent the "Malai" (clotted cream) layer on top.
